We see that PLE value is optimal now. You can also check with below query:
SELECT [object_name],
[counter_name],
[cntr_value] FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE [object_name] LIKE '%Manager%'
AND [counter_name] = 'Page life expectancy'
We observed that PLE value is fluctuating frequently. Page life expectancy can't be set automatically. It gives information about how much time a page resides in cache based on the memory settings given to SQL instance.
For better PLE value, increase the SQL memory and restart the SQL to effect the changes.
Note: As per MSIT standards, 80% of the memory should distribute Database engine and SSAS and SSRS. Remaining 20 % will take acre OS and TS. Let us know, if you have any queries form our end or we can proceed with closure.
