Creating a SQL Server DBA support flowchart for onboarding new applications onto AWS cloud involves several key steps, including planning, setup, configuration, and ongoing management. Hereâ€™s a simplified flowchart outline:

1. Initial Planning and Assessment
Start
Identify the application requirements.
Assess the database size, performance, and availability needs.
Determine the appropriate AWS services (e.g., EC2, RDS, SQL Server on AWS).
2. Database Design and Architecture
Database Design
Choose between AWS RDS for SQL Server or SQL Server on EC2.
Plan for high availability, disaster recovery, and security.
Design the database schema and select the appropriate SQL Server version.
AWS Architecture
Define the VPC, subnets, and security groups.
Plan the network connectivity (VPC Peering, Direct Connect, VPN).
Determine IAM roles and policies.
3. Infrastructure Setup
Provisioning
Set up AWS RDS instances or EC2 instances with SQL Server.
Configure storage options (EBS volumes, Provisioned IOPS).
Security Setup
Apply security groups and NACLs for network access.
Implement encryption (TDE, SSL/TLS).
Set up IAM roles for SQL Server management.
Monitoring and Alerts
Configure CloudWatch for monitoring SQL Server metrics.
Set up SNS alerts for performance issues or failures.
4. Database Migration
Data Migration
Choose the migration method (DMS, Backup/Restore, SSIS).
Perform initial data migration and verify integrity.
Test application connectivity and performance.
Cutover Planning
Plan the cutover strategy (minimizing downtime).
Execute the final migration and switchover.
Post-migration validation.
5. Application Onboarding
Integration Testing
Test the application with the new SQL Server environment.
Optimize queries and performance as needed.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Conduct UAT with the end-users.
Address any issues and re-test.
Go-Live
Schedule the go-live date.
Monitor closely post-go-live for any issues.
6. Ongoing Management and Support
Performance Monitoring
Regularly monitor SQL Server performance.
Use tools like CloudWatch, SQL Server Profiler, and Performance Monitor.
Backup and Recovery
Implement and test automated backups.
Set up point-in-time recovery and disaster recovery plans.
Patching and Maintenance
Schedule regular patching of SQL Server.
Conduct maintenance tasks such as index rebuilding and statistics updates.
7. Documentation and Handover
Documentation
Document the entire setup, including architecture, configurations, and procedures.
Create a runbook for the DBA team.
Handover
Conduct a handover session with the support team.
Ensure all monitoring and alerts are active.

This flowchart outlines the general steps, but you can expand or modify each step based on specific requirements. If you need a visual representation, tools like Lucidchart or Microsoft Visio can help you create a detailed flowchart.
